## 🧠 Methodologies Used

### Backward Chaining
This method starts from a hypothesis (e.g., a disease) and works backward to confirm it based on user-selected symptoms.

### Certainty Factor (CF)
Calculates the confidence level of the diagnosis based on the expert's belief and user input. The system displays how certain it is that the plant suffers from a specific disease.
